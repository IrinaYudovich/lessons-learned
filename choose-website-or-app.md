The decision to invest resources into developing a standard website, a responsive (i.e., dynamic mobile-enabled) site, or a native mobile app solution are contingent upon a variety of factors.
First, consider your budget and timeline. 
If these are significant constraints, and you envision the final deliverable requiring several iterations, an app may not be appropriate as development can be quite capital and time intensive. 

Additionally, one must be thoughtful about the functionality one wishes to offer with either of these options. 
Apps are ideal if you believe they will be utilized offline, if you want to offer simple one-click or one-swipe functionality, or if you want the app to be heavily integrated with native phone or table features, such as phone dialing, camera or GPS.

Other factors to consider include searchability and reach. 
Since websites are, by definition, on the web, anyone with a web browser and an Internet connection can find and interact with them.
However, an app first needs to be downloaded in order to be accessed, creating a potential barrier for the consumer.
