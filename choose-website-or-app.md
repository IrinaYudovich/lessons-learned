# The decision to invest resources into developing a standard website, a responsive (i.e., dynamic mobile-enabled) site, or a native mobile app solution are contingent upon a variety of factors.
## First, consider your budget and timeline. 
### If these are significant constraints, and you envision the final deliverable requiring several iterations, an app may not be appropriate as development can be quite capital and time intensive. 

# Additionally, one must be thoughtful about the functionality one wishes to offer with either of these options. 
## Apps are ideal if you believe they will be utilized offline, if you want to offer simple one-click or one-swipe functionality, or if you want the app to be heavily integrated with native phone or table features, such as phone dialing, camera or GPS.

# Other factors to consider include searchability and reach. 
## Since websites are, by definition, on the web, anyone with a web browser and an Internet connection can find and interact with them.
## However, an app first needs to be downloaded in order to be accessed, creating a potential barrier for the consumer.

# When it comes to interactivity and gaming, the ecosystem is clearly moving towards mobile. 
## Consider wildly popular zeitgeist games such as Angy Birds or Candy Crush - clearly, these are best suited to a moile app format.
